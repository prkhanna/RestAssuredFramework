when u get JDK problem while running with maven just make a configuration as runconfiguration and select JDk
13 version correctly and make mvn clean install. It should work.

we have used Junit version 4 hence I smoke segregating into smoke andregression there seems to problem
workaround have been done while creating interface and using @catgerioes
and also defining group in pom.xml.

To run allure report from local we need to download Allure cli and install in machine and provide path in enviornment variables
 and then open command prompt and run

allure serve path of allure folder in our case 
allure serve F:\RestAssured\RestFramework2\target\allure-results
